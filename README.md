I created this repository to study deep learning.
It contains two versions, one with the framework (Tensor flow) and one without.
The version without Tensor flow is based on O'Reilly Japan's Zero Tsuku (source is available free of charge).
The data used for training is not included in this repository due to copyright reasons.
